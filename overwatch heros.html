<h1> Overwatch Heroes Information</h1>
<br>
<p> Overwatch currently has 42 heroes and they all belong in different cateogries and are played differently from one another. In this article I will discuss the main three "roles" that each of these each set of heroes belong to, what each hero has in common.Additionally, in a typical OW match, there is 1 tank, 2 damage players, and 2 support players, currently </p>
<p> Here are the sections in this article</p>
<ul> 
    <li> Tanks</li>
    <li> Damage</li>
    <li> Support</li>
    <li> Weapons</li>
    <li> Abilites</li>
    <li> Ulitimates</li>
     </ul>

<h2> Overwatch Hero Roles</h2>
<p> Overwatch has 3 roles for each of its heroes. These are, Tanks, Damage, and Support</p>
<h3> Tank</h3>
<p> Tank Heroes are heroes which have high powered abilities and ultimates, high powered weapons, and have very high health pools and armor. </p>
<p> These heroes are typically responsible for taking in all the damage for their team, while also providing good amounts of damage and forceful disruptions to the enemy team. </p>
<p> However, despite these heroes having powerful abilities and large amounts of health, it is still a responsibility of the tank player to provide a balance of doing a good amount of damage to the enemy team but also knowing when to back off to get support. Not having this balance, can be considered "feeding" which is the process of going into the enemy team and dying without a good plan or strategy in mind.  </p>
<p> Some Heroes in this role, include, DVA, Roadhog, Orisa, Sigma, Mauga, and lots more</p>
<p> A couple of these heroes also have ways to block damage from the enemy, in the form of barriers, sucking abilities and more</p>

<h3> Damage</h3>
<p> Damage heroes are responsible for going to the enemy team to deliver high amounts of damage in short bursts, and/or deliver damage in covert manners</p>
<p> This group has the most heroes out of any group.</p>
<p> Each hero does damage and disrupts the enemy team in different ways and abilities</p>
<p> Some heroes are made to be played to damage the enemy from behind and in covert ways. </p>
<p> Some are made to take on the enemy in front, while coordinating with their team and while also delivering short amounts of damage</p>
<p> It is also important for Damage players, or DPS players, to also provide a balance of dealing good damage and disruptions but also being able to get out quickly to either get a health pack on a map, or get support from the healers. As mentioned above, not having this balance can also be considered feeding.</p>
<p> Additionally, DPS players should always, keep moving and never stay in one spot for too long, otherwise enemies, can find out quickly and get the advantage</p>
<h3> Support</h3>
<p> Support heroes are responsible for healing the team, providing extra damage and speed boosts, and disrupting the enemy team with their abilities.</p>
<p> Each hero here has different ways of disrupting, increasing damage, and healing.</p>
<p> Supports are the backbone of a team.</p>
<p> It is true, that supports are mostly responsible for healing the team and saving them, however it is equally important to increase the damage of the team, and also do damage to the enemy team with the disrupter abilites. </p>
<p> Only healing can make your role less useful to winning team fights, so it's important to try to strike a balance. </p>
<br>
<h2>  Weapons, Abilities and Ultimates</h2>
<h3> Weapons</h3>
<p> Every hero has a weapon and some require reloading and others do not.</p>
<p> Every hero has a primary fire, which is the main firing you use to damage the enemy and heal your team if you are support in some heroes. </p>
<p> Some heroes have secondary fire, which is the other fire that you use for alternate methods of damage or other protections, such as shields and such.</p>
<p> In Overwatch, heroes that reload do not have to look for ammo, and instead can immediallty gain ammo automatically after each reload. </p>
<h3> Abilities</h3>
<p> Every hero in OW has at least 2 or three abilities</p>
<p> These abilities are the main part of each hero and are used in a variety of ways.</p>
<p> Every hero's ability also has a cooldown which is basically a time where you can't use the ability.</p>
<p> Some abilities have short cooldowns like 5 or 2 seconds, while others for big abilities, can last up to 30 seconds.</p>
<p> So being aware of cooldowns is a big part of playing the game properly, as improperly using abilites can be the cause of losing fights. </p>
<p> So always be aware of cooldowns</p>
<h3> Ultimates</h3>
<p> These are basically big impact abilities and each hero also has this one</p>
<p> But the difference here is that these abilites must be charged before they can be used</p>
<p> These can be charged either passively, with dealing damage, or healing.</p>
<p> Some ultimates take longer to charge than others, so it's important to keep this in mind.</p>
<p> Additionally, it's also a good idea to try to use an ultimate for its intended purpose, because otherwise doing otherwise, can cause a waste of an ultimate which means you will have to charge the ultimate again</p>
<p> Also it's also a good idea to coordinate with your team to combine ultimates and abilities to create a massive advantage over the enemy team. Good teams combine ultimates all the time.</p>
<p> It's also a good idea to keep in mind that some ultimates can be canceled or disrupted from the enemy team's abilites. So this means, figuring out whether the enemy team has abilites can make a difference of having a successful ultimate or a wasteful one.</p>
